## Some honest thoughts

1) I'm a mathematician by degree, Delphi programmer by trade. ZERO experience with Rust
2) This project is so subject to my available time, I don't even know if I'll write anything after starting this repo
3) Wish me luck
4) I'll be honest, I'll definetely use Deepseek to help me learning Rust and thread through docs and whatnot
